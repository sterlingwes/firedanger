          <h2>About firedanger.ca</h2>
          <p>
            As the global climate continues to change, wild fires are
            increasingly a risk we face in all parts of the world. In Canada,
            our vast forests and grasslands provide ample fuel for this trend to
            continue. Whether you're in a rural area, a suburb, or a city - wild
            fires can affect you. They can endanger your home up close and they
            can pollute the air you breathe from afar.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site will leverage some of the open data sources available to
            alert you to any risks to your area.
